You can download this project [right here](https://github.com/SuzyWu2014/uno-in-Haskell)

You can find Uno instructions [right here](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Uno_(card_game))

# Run this game
1. To run our program, here are the commands:

```haskell
ghci Uno.hs 
uno 
```

# Example exressions for evaluation
1. You can type */help* to get help information dialog at any time during game, and also you can type other helpful commands, like typing */rule* to know how to play the game. At the same time, you still be able to type the number of cards to play.

2. When you don't have a card to play currently, the system will help you automatically draw a card and ask you whether you want to play this card or not. Type yes or anything else.
